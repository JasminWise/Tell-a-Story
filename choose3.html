            <h3> 
                The boy decides to sacrifice the nightingale wanting to give the red rose to the girl he loved.
                The nightingale was satisfied with this choice and happy to be able to help the boy.
                The nightingale stabs itself on a thorn of the white rose bush and turns the white roses into red ones. 
                The boy was overjoyed and did not take its sacrifice in vain.</h3>
