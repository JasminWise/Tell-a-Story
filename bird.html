            <h1>A Curious Bird</h1>
            <p>Perched up on a branch, a nightingale watches this young boy fall in love with the girl of his dreams. Realizing what he is after the nightingale, through its heart, wishes to help this boy. The nightingale, a small brown bird with a smooth slick shape, speeds through the crowd so as to not get hurt. The bird later on hears the weeps of the boy under an old tree and calls out to him to ask what is wrong.</p>
