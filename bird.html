            <p>In a quiet village surrounded by blooming gardens and ancient trees, 
                there lived a young man known for his poetic soul and a nightingale
                whose song echoed through the air like a gentle breeze. 
                The young man, enamored by the beauty of a local girl, longed to win
                her heart. He believed that a rare scarlet rose would be the perfect 
                token of his love.Perched up on a branch, a nightingale watches this young boy fall in love with the girl of his dreams.
                Realizing what he is after the nightingale, through its heart, wishes to help this boy.
                The nightingale, a small brown bird with a smooth slick shape, speeds through the crowd so as to not get hurt. 
                The bird later on hears the weeps of the boy under an old tree and calls out to him to ask what is wrong.</p>
