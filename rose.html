            <h2>The bird comes down from its spot in the tree to talk to the boy. The boy tells the bird that he does not have a red rose to give to the girl he has fallen in love with.
                The bird searches and searches for a red rose but can not find one. But the bird does find a bed of white roses.
                The bird tells the boy that a sacrifice must be made in order to attain a red rose.
