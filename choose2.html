            <h3>The boy realized that the girl would be okay without a red rose and decides to get her a more attainable gift.
                With that the boy walks away from the spot he was at under the tree.
                Telling the nightingale that a big sacrifice such as this one isn't worth a flower that will later on die.
                The boy then thanks the nightingale and is off to find another gift for the one he loves.
            </h3>
